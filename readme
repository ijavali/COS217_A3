------------------------------------------------------------------------
What authorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information given
in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab in the file
~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the readme file,
and edit it as appropriate.

The course's lectures.
The course's precepts.
The course's office hours.
The course's website.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It was not fun, but it was helpful. I learned how to use valgrind and how to
handle memory allocation which will be important as a developer.
I made silly mistakes, each of which cost me several hours debugging issues
due to using the wrong variable name, etc.
Writing 99% of the actual for the assignment didn't take me much
time because I'm familiar with linked lists and hash tables from before. 
Fixing the silly mistakes took the vast majority of the time I spent
on this assignment.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

No issues or bugs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   symtablelist.c: line 47: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablelist.c: line 118: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?

   symtablelist.c: line 142: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

I disagree with the warnings. For this assignment, a key can have associated
with it a null value. Both pvValue and pvExtra can have null values and 
asserts are not needed for them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   symtablehash.c: line 88: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablehash.c: line 213: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?

   symtablehash.c: line 227: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

I disagree with the warnings. For this assignment, a key can have associated
with it a null value. Both pvValue and pvExtra can have null values and 
asserts are not needed for them.

What are the CPU times reported by testsymtable.c with binding counts
50, 500, 5000, 50000, and 500000 using (1) your linked list
implementation, (2) your non-expanding hash table implementation, and
(3) your expanding hash table implementation? Fill in the blanks.

The linked list implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.002547 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 1.055199 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 104.353035 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed Killed seconds. It timed out on armlab.

The non-expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.006535 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.354360 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 68.666099 seconds.

The expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.008842 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.152903 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 1.657054 seconds.
